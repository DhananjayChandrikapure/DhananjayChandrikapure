## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Dhananjay Chandrikapure, a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a strong interest in information security, incident response, and system protection. Iâ€™ve completed an Advanced Certificate Course in High-Performance Computing and Cyber Security from CDAC, gaining hands-on experience with cybersecurity tools, technologies, and best practices.

Iâ€™ve worked on projects and internship tasks involving phishing analysis, threat intelligence, incident analysis, vulnerability management, and data recovery. Iâ€™ve also handled firewall management and configured IDS/IPS systems, building a solid foundation in security operations and network defense.

This portfolio highlights my personal projects, learning exercises, and research in cybersecurity. Iâ€™m passionate about staying updated, improving my skills, and contributing to the security community.

Currently seeking opportunities to grow as a Security Analyst and tackle real-world security challenges.





## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
To build a successful career in cybersecurity by applying my knowledge of security operations, incident analysis, and threat management. I aim to continuously learn, adapt to emerging security challenges, enhance my technical skills, and contribute to securing digital environments. My goal is to work in dynamic security teams, handle real-world incidents, and support organizations in strengthening their security posture â€” specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
